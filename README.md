# Data Engineering Project  

The goal of the Data Engineering project is to collect and organize data.

## Context

The Book Club is a book exchange startup. The business model works based on the exchange of books by the users, each book registered by the user gives the right to an exchange, but the user can also buy the book if he does not want to offer another book in exchange.

Therefore itÂ´s necessary to collect, store and organize the data from the website. The data that we need is
* The name of the book
* The category of the book.
* The number of stars the book received.
* The price of the book.
* Whether the book is in stock or not.

## The Data

The data to be collected and stored is available on this website: http://books.toscrape.com/
This website was developed and made available especially for practicing web scraping. There are no legal problems when collecting the data
